This repository houses the source code for the bot inside the Leyline.gg [discord server](https://discord.gg/7cjc5hRBZr). It is built off the [`discord.js`](https://discord.js.org/#/) framework. The bot is designed to operate in a single server, and has several custom features designed to integrate with the Leyline digital workspace. Please direct any questions to the admin of the repository through a Discord message to Ollog10#2051.
